As you finally plunged the blade into the boss, he then says in his dying breath
"Congratulation, all of this gold now belongs to you." all of a sudden, his body
disappears and the exit of the dungeon finally opens for you. You go back to the 
village and tell them that you have solved the dungeon. Then the people of the 
village celabrates and helps you with your reward for completing the dungeon,
you then return home and just sit back and relax from your successful journey.
